# Manipulating joint probability densities in python

The second part of the question that you have just completed is

The joint probability density function for the pair of continuous random variables (X,Y) is:

![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f(x,y)=k(x^2y^2%2Bxy^3)\quad\textrm{for}\quad\1<x<2\quad\textrm{and}\quad\0<y<3)

(2) Calculate the value of k

As you did in the exercise, we can solve this by noting that 1/k is equal to the integral of the part of the function above that appears in brackets over all space.  I would thus like you to write code to calculate this integral using SymPy in the panel on the right.  You need to set the variable called `k` equal to this quantity to pass.
